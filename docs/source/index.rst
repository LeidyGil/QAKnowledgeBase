Welcome to QA Knowledge Base!
===================================

**QAKnowledgeBase** is an inspiration about all the topics I have learned during my experience as a QA Software Engineer.

The idea is to share knowledge from different topics to people who is just starting in the Software Quality Assurance field 
and also for experienced QAs from who all the feedback, comments and knowledge is more than welcome.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
   QAKnowledgeBase hosts its documentation on Read the Docs.
